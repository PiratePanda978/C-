Now i know i might sound like i am complaining and whining about yet another thing, surprisingly i have come to notice that this has become a constant habit of mine in recent times.whining an complaining about mundane things which other people generally overlook. I dont know wether it is my inherent nature or it is because of the irritating nature of my college schedule or due to the fact that i am not where i think i should have been at this point of time. Now I understand that everyone has their own pace of doing things but why do i feel that my pace is slower than most of the people of my age. I see my classmates doing amazing things be it in arts or tech or any other personal areas of interest whereas i am stuck doing what the world commands me to do and whatever i think will make other people happy and put me in abetter light in their eyes.for exaample i am sitting here prsactising my typing skills whereas my colleagues are out their enjoying their lifes.";
